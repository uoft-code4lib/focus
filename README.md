# Code4Lib - University of Toronto - Focus On Research

This directory contains the HTML templates for Focus. 

Please modify the files are you wish.

The goal is to beautify the site.

There are 3 templates to play with:

1. Front Page
2. Personal Profile
3. General List

You can choose to work on which ever.

HTML5, CSS3 and any JQuery codes are welcomed.

It'll be nice if the code is cross-browser compatible, but it's not a priority.
